    <h3>Notes for this week</h3>
    <h4 class="listHeader">Javascript: Novice to Ninja Chapter 2: Programming Basics</h4>
    <ul class="weeklyNotes">
        <li><b>Comments:</b></li>
        <li>Single line comments start with // and finishes at the end of the line</li>
        <li>Multi-line comments start with /* and finishes with */</li>
        <li><b>JavaScript Grammar:</b></li>
        <li>It's considered best practice to combine the two and write each statement on a new line, terminated by a semi-colon, like so:<br>
        const message = 'Hello World!';<br>
        alert(message);</li>
        <li>A block is a series of statements that are collected together inside curly braces:<br>
        {<br>
        // this is a block containing 2 statements<br>
        const message = 'Hello!';<br>
        alert(message);<br>
        }<br></li>
        <li><b>Reserved Words:</b></li>
        <li>The following words are reserved for JavaScript language and cannot be used to name variables:<br>abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const, continue, debugger, default, delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends, false, final, finally, float, for, function, goto, if, implements, import, in instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native, new, null, package, private, protected, public, return, short, static, super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, throws, transient, true, try, typeof, var, volatile, void, while, with, yield</li>
        <li>These words are not reserved but really should have been:<br>undefined, NaN, Infinity</li>
        <li><b>Primitive Date Types:</b></li>
        <li>JavaScript has seven different data types. Six of them are primitive data types and are: string, symbol, number, boolean, undefined, and null</li>
        <li>Any value that isn't listed above is just an object. That includes arrays, functions, and object literals.</li>
        <li><b>Variables:</b></li>
        <li>It may seem like a restriction to use const, but it actually helps make your programs more predictable if the assignment to variables can't change.</li>
        <li>variables declared using let and const have block scope, which is discussed in more detail below.</li>
        <li><b>Scope:</b></li>
        <li>Global Scope is any variable that is declared outside of a block. This means it is accessible everywhere in the program. This is not considered good practice.</li>
        <li>Local Scope is any variable that is defined inside a block using let or const. They will only be available inside that block and not be accessible outside of that block.</li>
        <li><b>Naming Constants + Variables:</b></li>
        <li>Constant and variable names can start with any upper or lower-case letter, an underscore, or dollar sign. They can also contain numbers, but cannot start with them.</li>
        <li>When using multiple words for constant and variable names there are two conventions:<br>
        Camel case starts with a lowercase letter and then each new word is capitalized: firstNameAndLastName<br>
        Underscore separates each new word with an underscore: first_name_and_last_name</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="listHeader">Javascript: Novice to Ninja Chapter 3: Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h4>
    <ul class="weeklyNotes">
        <li>Data structures used in JavaScript to store lists of values are called arrays, sets, and maps.</li>
        <li>An ARRAY is an ordered list of values.</li>
        <li>The delete operator will remove an item from an array: delete avengers[3];</li>
        <li>Destructuring an array is the concept of taking values out of an array and presentig them as individual values. ex: const[x,y] = [1,2];</li>
        <li>To remove the last item from an array we can use the pop() method: avengers.pop()</li>
        <li>The shift method works in a similar way but it removes the first item in the array: avengers.shift();</li>
        <li>The push method appends a new value to the end of the array: avengers.push('Thor');</li>
        <li>The unshift method is similar to the push but it adds a new item to the beginning of the array: avengers.unshift('Captain America');</li>
        <li>You can MERGE arrays by using the concat() method: avengers.concat(['Hulk','Hawkeye','Black Widow']);</li>
        <li>The join() methos can be used to turn the array into a string that comprises all the items in the array, separated by commas: avengers.join();<br> You can also choose a seperator other than a comma by placing it inside the parentheses: avengers.join('&');</li>
        <li>Values can be placed into a set using the add method: list.add(1);</li>
        <li>Multiple items can be placed in a set by repeating the add() method: lits.add(2).add(3).add(4);</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="listHeader">Javascript: Novice to Ninja Chapter 4: Functions</h4>
    <ul class="weeklyNotes">
        <li>A function is a chunk of code that can be referenced by a name, and is almost like a small, self-contained mini program.</li>
