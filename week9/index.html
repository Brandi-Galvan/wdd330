    <h3>Notes for this week</h3>
    <h4 class="listHeader">NTN Ch 9: The Window Object</h4>
    <ul class="weeklyNotes">
        The Browser Object Model
        <li>The Browser Object Model (BOM) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen.</li>
        <li>Every browser window, tab, popup, frame, and iframe has a window object.</li>
        <li>For environments (like Node.js) that don't have a window object, they will still have a global object.<br>For example: const global = this; is a way of assigning the variable global to the global object.</li>
        <li>Global variables that are created without using the const, let, or var keywords. Global variables can be accessed in all part of the program.</li>
        <li>Global variables are actual properties of a global object. The global object is the window object. So any global variable created is actually a property of the window object.<br>For example: x = 6; <b>the global variable is created</b><br>window.x <b>the same variable can be accessed as a property of the window object.</b><br>window.x === x; <b>Both variables are now exactly the same.</b></li>
        Browser information
        <li>The window object has a number of properties and methods that provide information about the user's browser.</li>
        <li>The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page.</li>
        <li>The href property returns the full URL as a strong. You can also change the URL using this property.</li>
        <li>The protocol property returns a string describing the protocol used.</li>
        <li>The host property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL and the port number.</li>
        <li>The hostname property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL.</li>
        <li>The port property returns a string describing the port number, although it will return an empty string if the port is not explicitly stated in the URL.</li>
        <li>The pathname property returns a string of the path that follows the domain.</li>
        <li>The search property returns a string that starts with a "?" followed by the query string parameters.</li>
        The Browser History
        <li>The window.history property can be used to access information about any previously visited pages in the current browser session. Avoid confusing this with the new HTML5 History API.</li>
        <li>The window.history.length property shows how many pages have been visited before arriving at the current page.</li>
        <li>The window.history.go() method can be used to go to a specific page, where 0 is the current page.<br>For example: window.history.go(1); (this goes forward 1 page)<br>window.history.go(0); (this reloads the current page)<br>window.history.go(-1); (this goes back 1 page).</li>
        Controlling Windows
        <li>A new window can be opened using the window.opn() method.</li>
        <li>This takes the URL of the page to be opened as its first parameter, the window title as its second parameter, and a list of attributes as the third parameter. This can also be assigned to a variable, so the window can then be referenced later in the code:<br>const pop = window.opn('https://sitepoint.com','SitePoint','width=400,height=400,resizable=yes');</li>
        Screen information
        <li>The window,screen object contains information about the screen the browser is displayed on. You can find the heigh and width of the screen in pixels using the height and width properties.</li>
        <li>The availaHeight and availWidth can be used to find the heigh and width of the screen, excluding any operating system menus.</li>
        <li>The colorDepth property can be used to find the color bit depth of the user's monitor, although there are few use cases for doing this other than collecting user statistics.</li>
        The Document Object 
        <li>Each window object contains a document object. This object has properties and methods that deal with the page that has been loaded into the window.</li>
        <li>The write() method simply writes a string of text to the page. If a page has already loaded, it will completely replace the current document.</li>
        <li>Another option is to include the HTML in the string and this will become part of the DOM tree.<br>For example: document.write('< h1 > Hellow, world!</ h1 >');</li>
        <li>You can also use the document.write() method inside script tags within an HTML element on a page. This will not overwrite everything else on the page.</li>
</ul>

    <h4 class="listHeader">NTN Ch 14: HTML 5 APIs</h4>
    <ul class="weeklyNotes">
        HTML5
        <li>There are going to be more updates to HTML5 than previously. There is already a HTML5.1 and 5.2 is already in development.</li>
        The data- Attribute
        <li>The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser.</li>
        <li>They're also private to a page, so are not intended to be used by an external service - their sole purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program.</li>
        <li>So, this means they're perfect for adding data that can be used as a hook that the program utilizes to access information about a particular element on the page.</li>
        <li>The names of these attributes can be decided by the developer, but they must use the following format:<br>· Start with data-<br>·Contain only lowercase letters, numbers, dots, colons, or underscores.<br>·Include an optional string value.</li>
        <li>An example of this could be:<br>data-powers = 'flight superSpeed'<br>data-rating = '5'<br>data-max-length = '32'</li>
        <li>You can then use the attributes to identify particular elements. For example, you could final all the elements that have a data-rating value of 3 or more.</li>
        HTML5 APIs
        <li>The HTML5 specification contains a number of APIS that helps to gain access to hardware, such as cameras, batteries, geolocation, and the graphics card.</li>
        HTML5 Web Storage 
        <li>The web storage API provides a key-value store on the client's computer that is similar to using cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use.</li>
        <li>If a browser supports the Web Storage API, the window object will have a property called localStorage, which is a native object with a number of properties and methods used to store data.</li>
        <li>The information is saved in the form of key-value pairs, and the values can only be strings.</li>
        Geolocation 
        <li>The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device. This means it can be used to find the user's exact location, then link to nearby places or measure the speed at which the user is moving.</li>
        <li>If geolocation is available, it will be a property of the navigator object that we met in Chapter 9. This property has a method called getCurrentPosition() that will return a position object to a specified callback function, called youAreHere() in the example:<br>navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(youAreHere);</li>
        <li>Additionally, the geolocation object has a watchPosition() method that will call a callback function every time the position of the device is updated.</li>
        Web Workers
        <li>Web Workers allow processes to be run in the background, adding support for concurrency in JavaScript.</li>
        <li>To get started, use the Worker() constructor function to create a new worker:<br>const worker = new Worker('task.js');</li>
    </ul>
