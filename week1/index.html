    <h3>Notes for this week</h3>
    <h4 class="listHeader">Doing Stuff with Web Things 2.3: Remembering User's Info</h4>
    <ul class="weeklyNotes">
        <li>Computers are stupid, even though they seem smart.</li>
        <li>Any information stored or shared with a user is called OUTPUT.</li>
        <li>Anything coming from where it was stored or anything the user enters is called INPUT.</li>
        <li>The section tag fills the screen all the way across</li>
        <li>In JS, in order to get the user’s input from any input or text area tag, you use the special word ‘value’.</li>
        <li>When you want to show something to a user, you use a section and the special word ‘innerHTML’.</li>
        <li>Input or textarea USE value</li>
        <li>Section USE innerHTML</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="listHeader">Doing Stuff with Web Things 2.4: Making Choices</h4>
    <ul class="weeklyNotes">
        <li>'else' doesn't do any comparison checks. If you try to do a comparison check with an else, your code will fail.</li>
        <li>'else' is only there for when none of the other comparison checks are true.</li>
        <li>the general rule of thumb, “Don’t do to your users what you don’t like done to you”</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="listHeader">Doing Stuff with Web Things 2.5: Groups and Loops</h4>
    <ul class="weeklyNotes">
        <li>A loop is something that makes stuff happen over and over again.</li>
        <li>The type of loop specifically designed to work with arrays is called a 'for loop.'</li>
        <li>The standard 'for loop' parts when working with an array are: the 'for' keyword, a variable to keep track of the location you are at in the array (i=0), a check to see if the loop should continue (i less than symbol 7), an update that increases the location tracking variable by one (i++), and the lines of code to execute every time you go through the loop.</li>
        <li>The '+=' is an operator that takes the variable on the right of it and adds it to the whatever is to the left of it. (ex: 17 += 3 is 20).</li>
    </ul>
    <hr class="activityBreak">
    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <ul class="weeklyNotes">
        <li>Why are we using the id 'name_input' in the excercises without quotations arpund it like other id values?</li>
        <li>Just a heads up, the code on page 47 in the even_or_odd.html code sample line 16 (and pg48 ln25) is incorrect and should show the id as 'number_input' not 'name_input'.</li>
    </ul>
