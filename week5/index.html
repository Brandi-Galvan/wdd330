    <h3>Notes for this week</h3>
    <h4 class="listHeader">NTN Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging</h4>
    <ul class="weeklyNotes">Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings
        <li>Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They usually are:</li>
        <li>System Error: there's a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting</li>
        <li>Programmer Error: the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.</li>
        <li>User Error: the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</li>
        <br>
        <li>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.</li>
        <li>Stack Traces will be produced by an exception. This is a sequence of functions or method calls that pead to the point where the error occurred.</li>
        <li>A stack trace will work backwards from the point at which the error occurred to identify the original function or method that started the sequence.</li>
        <li>Warnings can occur if there's an error in a code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. A program can continue to run after a warning, but can be problematic.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="weeklyNotes">The Importance of Testing and Debugging
        <li>Every programmer should ensure that the code they write fails loudly in development so any errors can be identified and fixed quickly.</li>
        <li>During development, a programmer should try to make the code fail gracefully so the user experience is not affected, if possible.</li>
        <li>This can be achieved by making sure exceptions are caught and dealt with, and code is tested rigorously.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="weeklyNotes">Strict Mode
        <li>Strict Mode considers coding practices that were previously accepted as just being 'poor style' as actual errors.</li>
        <li>Writing code in strict mode can help improve clarity and speed since it follows conventions and will throw exceptions if any sloppy code practices are used.</li>
        <li>Not writing code in strict mode is often referred to as 'sloppy mode' as it's forgiving of sloppy programming practices.</li>
        <li>You can invoke strict mode by simply adding this line of code at the top of your JavaScript file: 'use strict';</li>
        <br>Linting Tools<br>
        <li>Linting tool examples are JS Lint, JS Hint, ES Lint. These can be used to test the quality of JavaScript code, beyond simply using strict mode.</li>
        <li>They are designed to highligiht any sloppy programming practices or syntax errors, and will complain if certain style conventions are not followed, such as how code is indented. They can be very unforgiving and use some opinnionated coding conventions, such as not and using the ++ and -- increments operators.</li>
        <li>Linting tools are also useful for enforcing a programming style guide. This is particularly userful when you are working in a team, as it ensure everybody follows the same conventions.</li>
        <li>Passing a lint test is no guarantee that your code is correct, but it will mean it will be more consistent and less likely to have problems.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="weeklyNotes">Feature Detection
        <li>Programming in JavaScript can be something of a moving target as the APIs it uses are in constant state of flux.</li>
        <li>The recommended way to determine browser support for a feature is to use feature detection. This is done using an if statement to check whether an ovject or method exists before trying to actually call the method. For example, say we want to use the shiny new holoDeck API we would wrap any method calls inside the following if block.</li>
        <br>Debugging in the Browser<br>
        <li>Debugging is the process of finding out where the bugs occur in the code and then dealing with them.</li>
        <li>In many cases, the point at which an error occurs is not always where it originated, so you'll need to run through the program to see what's happening at different stages of its ecxecution.</li>
        <br>Error Objects<br>
        <li>An error object can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs, or it can be created in the code using a constructor function, like so: const error = new Error();</li>
        There are seven more error objects used for specific errors:
        <li>Eval Error: is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only reetained for backwards compatability. It was used to identify errors when using the global eval() function.</li>
        <li>RangeError: is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.</li>
        <li>referenceError: is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn't exist. For example, calling a function that hasn't been defined.</li>
        <li>SyntaxError: is thrown when there's an error in the code's syntax.</li>
        <li>TypeError: is thrown when there's an error in the type of calue used; for example, a string is used when a number is expected.</li>
        <li>URIError: is thrown when there's a problem encoding or decoding the URI.</li>
        <li>InternalError: is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in the JavaScript engine. A common cause of this too much recursion.</li>
        <br>Exception Handling<br>
        <li>When an exception occursm the program terminates with an error message, This is ideal in development as it allows us to identify and fix errors.</li>
        <li>It is possible to handle exceptions gracefully by catching the error. Any errors can be hidden from users, but still identified.</li>
        <li>TRY: If we suspect a piece of code will result in an exception, we can wrap it in a try block. This will run the code inside the block as normal, but if an exception occurs it will pass the error object that is thrown onto a catch block.</li>
        <li>The code inside the catch block will only run if an exception is thrown inside the try block. The error object is automatically passed as a parameter to the catch block.</li>
        <br>Testing<br>
        <li>Testing is an important part of programming that can often be overlooked. Writing good tests means your code will be less brittle as it develops, and any errors will be identified early on.</li>
        <li>A test can simply be a function that tests a piece of code runs as it should. For example, we could test that the squareRoot() function returns the correct answer with the following function<br><i>function</i> itsSquareRoots4() {<br><i>return</i> squareRoot(4) ===2 ;<br>}</li>
        <li>In the function above we are comparing the result of squareRoot(4) with the number 2. This will return true if our function works as expected.</li>
        <br>Test-Driven Development<br>
        <li>Test-driven development(TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual code.</li>
